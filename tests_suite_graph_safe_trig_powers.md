# Safe Trigonometric Functions Test Suite Documentation

## Overview
This document presents the results of the test suite for safe trigonometric functions. The tests evaluate the numerical accuracy, stability, and performance of safe implementations of trigonometric functions compared to standard NumPy implementations. Results are provided in numerical summaries and visual plots.

## Test Components
The test suite includes the following major evaluations:

1. **Critical Points Testing**: Evaluates function accuracy at critical points where floating-point errors are common.
2. **Matrix and Vector Testing**: Tests function behavior on structured data such as matrices and vectors.
3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Compares execution times between standard NumPy functions and safe implementations.
4. **Visualization and Graphical Analysis**: Generates plots for errors, performance, and function behavior.

## 1. Critical Points Testing
The test suite evaluates trigonometric functions near critical points such as:

- **Sine Functions**: 0, π, 2π, -2π, and their multiples (3π, 10π, etc.).
- **Cosine Functions**: π/2, -π/2, 3π/2, -3π/2, and their multiples.

### Methods:
- Small perturbations (e.g., 1e-15, 1e-12, 1e-9) are added to critical points.
- Differences between standard and safe function outputs are recorded.
- Maximum absolute and relative errors are reported.

### Summary:
- The safe implementations significantly reduce errors near critical points.
- Detailed numerical error summaries are logged for each function.
- Results are visualized in error plots.

## 2. Matrix and Vector Testing
Tests safe functions on:
- A **10x10 matrix** with random values and selected critical points.
- A **20-element vector** including critical points.

### Summary:
- The test confirms stability and numerical correctness in structured data.
- Maximum absolute differences are computed.
- Checks for NaNs or Infs ensure function reliability.

## 3. Performance Benchmarking
This test compares execution times for different array sizes (1,000; 5,000; 10,000 elements).

### Summary:
- Safe functions are slower than NumPy equivalents due to additional stability checks.
- The slowdown factor is computed for each function.
- Performance degradation is analyzed across different input sizes.

## 4. Visualization and Graphical Analysis
### Generated Plots:
1. **Critical Points Errors**: Visual representation of absolute and relative errors.
2. **Performance Comparison**: Execution time vs. input size.
3. **Error Distributions**: Box plots showing statistical distribution of errors.
4. **Function Behavior**: Graphs of standard and safe functions over a range of inputs.

## Conclusion
The safe trigonometric functions demonstrate superior accuracy near critical points with a trade-off in performance. Graphical plots illustrate error distributions and computational costs. The provided safe implementations ensure robust numerical behavior in scientific computations.
